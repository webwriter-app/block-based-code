# WebWriter Blocks Widget
The blocks Widget brings block based programming to [WebWriter](https://webwriter.app).
The widget is based on the [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) library and is heavily inspired by the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) project.
Currently, the only available stage type is a simple canvas, but more stages can be added in the future.
The stage is controlled by the blocks that are placed in the editor.
